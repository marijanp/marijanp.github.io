Hi! My name is Marijan, I'm a freelancing Software Engineer and this blog/ homepage is aimed to be a place for topics concerning Haskell, C++, Nix/ NixOS and Software Engineering.

One might ask the question "But why exactly these topics?"

During my journey so far I worked with several different languages and technologies [professionally](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marijanp) as well as in my free-time, and the following shall shortly answer the question:

 - C++: Most of my professional carreer I worked with C++. One of the reasons was of course the domain. When working on software that needs to be performant or close to the hardware, one will encounter C++ with a great certainty.
 - Haskell: I'm a "convinced" Haskell user. Haskells powerfull static and strict typesystem, the encapsulation of I/O through the IO Monad, monad stacks, libraries like hspec, QuickCheck, servant, esqueleto etc. make it the most powerfull language to write robust/ high quality application software.
 - Nix/ NixOS: Sooner or later every Software Engineer will get frustrated managing dependencies (runtime, build or environment). Moreover the Software Engineer will have the desire to deploy the developed applications in production. The Nix ecosystem gave me the most powerfull tools I found so far to solve these problems.
