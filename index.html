Hello, my name is Marijan!
<br>
I'm an independent consultant for Software Engineering and DevOps, who lays great emphasis on software design, and reproducible and regression-free software development. I have experience in application- and backend development and DevOps in different contexts like Fintech, Robotics, and Deep Learning. I work with functional languages like Haskell, Nix/NixOS, and PureScript. Previously I used to work with modern C++.
<br>
<br>
I was born and raised in Germany, graduated in Informatics at the <a href="https://www.informatik.kit.edu/" class="text-black">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</a> and currently live on the Dalmatian coast in Croatia.
<br>
<br>
You can contact me in various languages: English (professional), German (native), Croatian (native), Spanish (fundamentals)
