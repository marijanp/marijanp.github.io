I'm an independent consultant for Software Engineering and DevOps. I lay great emphasis on software design and reproducible and regression-free software development. I have experience in application- and backend development and DevOps in different contexts. Some of these contexts are Fintech, Robotics, and Deep Learning. I work with functional languages like Haskell, Nix/NixOS, and PureScript. Previously I used to work with modern C++.
<br>
<br>
I was born and raised in Germany, graduated in Informatics at the <a href="https://www.informatik.kit.edu/" class="text-black">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</a>, and live in Croatia on the Dalmatian coast.

You can contact me in the following languages: English (professional), German (native), Croatian (native), Spanish (basic).
