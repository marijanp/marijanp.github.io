  I'm an independent consultant for Software Engineering and DevOps. I lay great
  emphasis on software design and reproducible and regression-free software
  development. I have experience in application- and backend development and
  DevOps in different contexts. Some of these contexts are Fintech, Robotics,
  and Deep Learning. I work with functional languages like Haskell, Nix/NixOS,
  and PureScript. Previously I used to work with modern C++.

  <br />
  I was born and raised in Germany, graduated in Informatics at the
  <a class="link" href="https://www.informatik.kit.edu/"

  You can contact me in the following languages: English (professional), German
  (native), Croatian (native), Spanish (basic).
